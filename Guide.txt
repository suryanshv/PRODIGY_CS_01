Cesear Cipher Implementation

I have created a web-based application that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher using flask as it is a lightweight framework for python. Flask will serve the web pages and handle user inputs, while the Caesar Cipher logic will be implemented in Python.

Steps:
1. Install flask - if you didn't have installed flask then open terminal and write - 
'pip install flask'

2. the logic for ceaser cipher is written in ceaser_cipher1.py file. it handles the flask application, Caesar Cipher logic, and handles HTTP requests.

3. The HTML file is in 'templates' folder named as 'index.html'. This file defines the structure of the web page.

4. The CSS file is in 'templates' folder named as 'index.html'. This file defines the structure of the web page.

5. To run the application, go to the location where you have saved the file using 'cd'
[cd "C:\Users\SURYANSH VERMA\Desktop\Prodigy\Ceaser Cipher\app.py"]
then type 'python app.py' in terminal

6. it will be running on localhost - http://127.0.0.1:5000 (you can press ctrl and left mouse button to open the link)

7. It will open a page having 2 fields - message and shift key, then choose whether you want to encrypt the message or decrypt. After clicking on the button it will display the result
