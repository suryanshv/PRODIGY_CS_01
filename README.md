# PRODIGY_CS_01
This repository is about Ceaser Cipher algorithm created in python language. Users have to input a message an specify a shift value to encrypt and decrypt a message.

Working:-

Encryption: Shift each letter of message by the shift value chosen by user.
Decryption: Performs shifting in reverse to restore the original message by providing the same shift value used when message was decrypted.
Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
